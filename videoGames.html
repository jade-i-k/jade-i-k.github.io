		<!--Beginning text stuff-->
		<h1 id="videoGames" style = "text-align: center; font-size: 80px;">Video Games</h1>
		<p style = "color: #AD3571;">This is where I talk about videos games i guess blah blah blah etc etc video games rule i dont even play them that often but whatever</p>

		<!--Undertale-->
		<div id = "undertale">
			<h2 style = "text-align: center; font-size: 50px">Undertale</h2>
			<img src = "./img/undertale.png" width = 100%>
			<p style = "color: #AD3571;">The soundtrack for this game was one of the main reasons I decided to play it. The only reason I didn't play it sooner is because it is notoriously difficult...<br><br>What makes this game so special is the fact that the story will forever be influenced by anything you had done before in the past, even if you delete your save file, quit the game before it says it has saved, or start a new game. <br><br> *SPOILERS* <br>Many players leave the "Genocide" playthrough for the end, since it can permanently alter the game for the worst. I am currently still on my first playthrough, trying to complete the "True Pacifist" storyline!</p>

		<!--Breath of the Wild-->
		<div id = "BOTW">
			<h2 style = "text-align: center; font-size: 50px">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h2>
			<img src = "./img/zelda.jpg" width = 90% class = "center">
			<p style = "color: #AD3571;">This is one of the most spoken about games for the switch for a very good reason. It's soOoooOo good! I played this game for hours on end trying to defeat monsters, complete quests, and eventually defeat Ganon. </p>
		</div>

		<!--Ni No Kuni-->
		<div id = "niNoKuni">
			<h2 style = "text-align: center; font-size: 50px">Ni No Kuni</h2>
			<img src = "./img/niNoKuni.jpg" width = 90% class = "center">
			<p style = "color: #AD3571;">Literally my favorite game from my childhood. I played this game so much when I was younger I became physically ill. There is now a version of it on the Nintendo Switch but I played it on the Playstation when it first came out. I'm almost done with Ni no kuni II, but since I haven't been home I can't continue to play. </p>

		<!--Moonlighter-->
		<div id = "moonlighter">
			<h2 style = "text-align: center; font-size: 50px">Moonlighter</h2>
			<img src = "./img/moonlighter.jpg" width = 90% class = "center">
			<p style = "color: #AD3571;">Raid dungeons, kill monsters, sell their loot, rinse + repeat</p>
		</div>

		<!--Stardew Valley-->
		<div id = "stardew">
			<h2 style = "text-align: center; font-size: 50px">Stardew Valley</h2>
			<img src = "./img/stardew.png" width = 90% class = "center">
			<p style = "color: #AD3571;">Literally the most wholesome game about farming. I'm almost on Year 3 :0</p>
